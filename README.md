SiLift Mirror
=============

This repository is a clone of the official SiLift update Site at http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/Projekte/SiLift/updatesite .

CoWolf is using SiLift to find differences between model versions.
Unfortunatelly, SiLift has no stable API, yet, thus a new SiLift version can lead to programm errors in CoWolf.

To be independent of SiLift updates, CoWolf uses this repository for SiLift instead of the official one.
It contains a SiLift version that is known to run well with CoWolf.


The SiLift official website is: http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/Projekte/SiLift/index.php
